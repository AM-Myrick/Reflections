When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I'd think that you'd always want to use a remote repository rather than keep work
    local. Github can be used so that you always have a backup of your code. It'd be
    awful to be unable to turn on your computer one day and realize you'd lost your work.
    You'd also want to use a remote repository for collaboration purposes and so that others
    can see your projects.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If you're collaborating with someone else and Git automatically pulls changes, you'll
    suddenly be working with different code and won't be sure why. If a change is made that
    introduces a bug, you wouldn't want your local directory automatically updating to that.
    Manual pulls allow you the most control and understanding of your code and your machine.
